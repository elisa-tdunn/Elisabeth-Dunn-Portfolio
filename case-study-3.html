                        Outreach, a platform historically focused on sales prospecting workflows, faced a significant challenge. While the company had traditionally supported sales reps with prospecting tasks (cold calling, emailing, scheduling meetings), there was a new initiative to support deal management (prioritizing, tracking, and monitoring deals in the pipeline). However, these two critical aspects of the sales process were managed in isolation, which hindered the overall efficiency of our users.

                    Recognizing the need for a holistic solution, I collaborated with product management and other designers to envision a new feature. This feature envisioned a "sales pipeline funnel" calculator that would use historical data and AI algorithms to project the number of deals won for a given quarter. This innovation aimed to help sales managers estimate the additional prospecting efforts required to meet their sales quotas.
                </p>
                
                <p class="case-section-text">
                    These early designs were shared with the entire Product-Design-Engineering (PDE) organization and directly with the Chief Product Officer (CPO) to gather preliminary feedback and generate excitement around the concept.

                    Product leadership at Outreach was enthusiastic about the project, eager to start development as soon as possible. However, little validation had been conducted to ensure the design met user expectations. Furthermore, no plans existed for integrating this feature into the existing ecosystem.

                <p class="case-section-text">
                    To address these concerns, I collaborated with Product Management, Engineering, and Data Science to create a project timeline. This timeline allowed for Engineering and Data Science work to be completed a month before the annual sales conference, which was the target for beta readiness. It also incorporated time for discovery and evaluative research.

                    In collaboration with my Product Manager, I explored synergies with another product vertical known as Deal Intelligence. This team was planning to create a Deal Insights dashboard for sales managers, which appeared to be a suitable home for our new feature. However, since my team was ahead in terms of development, we faced questions about how the new dashboard would look and function and how our feature would fit. To provide the Deal Intelligence team time to catch up, I initiated the discovery research phase.

                    I defined three main types of insights: recommendation on how to improve, acknowledgment of being on track, and acknowledgement of exceeding your goal.

                <p class="case-section-text">
                    The "recommendation" purposely uses a "light bulb" icon and a filled background to draw the eye to that area. Conversely, the latter two insight banners do not have a filled background. This is so that color is used deliberately for important information that needs action.

                    The project's timeline was extended due to organizational changes. Thus, Data Science and Engineering were set to complete their work a month after the initial deadline. After releasing to private beta, our next step is to implement the functionality of allowing managers to see their team member's contributions to the sales pipeline. We'll also be monitoring overall usage and potentially usability issues we'll need to address.
