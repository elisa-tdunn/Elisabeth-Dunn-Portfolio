                        Outreach's Design Systems team completed a complete visual rehaul of the product's components in order to move into a more modern look. Designers were tasked with updating their surfaces with the new "restyled" components. My work spanned multiple surfaces, one of which was the SMS feature. Since we were already in the mindset of "update and improve", this project was focused both on 1:1 migration and fixing any usability issues that lingered in the flagship version.

                <p class="case-section-text">
                    The first iteration resulted in us creating text bubbles that an 8px rounded corner, so that they look more like rectangles rather than full ovals. We also made the sender's text bubble color a dark gray and the receiver's text bubble white, so that there would be no overlap from the colors used for buttons or interactive objects. To synergize with this change, I changed the texting background be a light shade of gray supported by our new design system.
                </p>
                
                <p class="case-section-text">
                    However, there was also concerns from the Design Systems team that the usage of such dark colors for a prominent, recurring component would not match the new visual style of the product.

                <p class="case-section-text">
                    Thus, we moved forward with a different version where the sender's text bubble was a shade of purple that was more complimentary to our product's new look. With our new colors for the text bubbles, we needed a white background in order to be compliant with color contrast standards. To solve for this issue in the one-off SMS dialog, I opted for a border around the texting interface.

                    We removed the avatar component for the sender. We also stickied the typing interface to the bottom of the screen, so that users always have access to it.

                    The flagship version of the SMS platform also had the issue of line lengths spanning way past the point of optimal readability. Therefore, I defined when text bubbles should wrap across the 3 different widths we supported.

                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">• For surfaces with narrower widths (640px and narrower), the max line length was 45 characters</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">• For surfaces with wider widths (641px and higher), text bubbles wrapped after 75 characters.</li>

                    The updates to SMS were shipped to our customers in March 2023. Through some of our customer feedback channels, we've heard about customer appreciating the new SMS experience especially in the Tasks surface, due to giving them more space to both view and type messages. The design of the "Send" button has also been utilized in different parts of the product, such as our new AI Assist feature.

                <p class="case-section-text">
                    Next, we'll be testing if we should incorporate a "Scroll-away" functionality for the Subject Line in Tasks, to further increase the amount of reading space for our users.
