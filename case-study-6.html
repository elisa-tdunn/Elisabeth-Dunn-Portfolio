                        COCO (Caregiving for Caregivers Online) is a B2B startup that provides wellness interventions for caregivers through their personable chatbot AI, CocoBot. While working on a team with one other designer and two dedicated researchers, we aimed to enhance how caregivers approached and practiced self wellness.

                    Nonprofessional family caregivers dedicate their time, attention, and emotion toward improving the wellbeing of their loved ones with chronic conditions. Oftentimes, caregivers forget their own needs in the process. Our goal was to utilize COCO's mobile app and chatbot AI to help these caregivers take better care of themselves. However, our first step was to conduct research on caregivers' day-to-day lives and why they currently face blockers to self-care.

                    A competitive analysis of 18 apps in the realm of mental healthcare and chatbot AI, a 1-week diary study of 5 participants followed by contextual interviews, and a review of 62 academic research papers. We conducted thematic analysis across our different methods, which included quotes from participants, photos from the diary study, snippets from the literature review, and findings from the competitive analysis.

                    Due to the constraints of working within the confines of a mobile app and utilizing this app's chatbot AI, we focused on which pain points would be best addressed via our intervention. We settled on three main pain points.

                    Since users would primarily be coming to the CocoBot app for the chatting feature, we decided to support a chat-based onboarding experience to encourage caregivers to set up time for themselves. I provided quick response options, so that caregivers can spend less time deliberating and also get inspiration for what they'd want to focus their time on. I also designed a manual pathway of setting up goals and focus mode.

                    Caregivers would also have a dedicated space or "mode" to action on their self-wellness. We'd notify them of their scheduled Quiet Time via push notifications, but also give them flexibility to reschedule or skip Quiet Time sessions. When caregivers choose to skip a session or shorten their session, we made sure to confirm their option using guiltless language.

                    After polling the users we tested with, "Recharge" as a term was more well-received and made more sense for the activities users wanted to partake in. So, we updated all of our copy to reflect the change. We also added illustrations of the company's CocoBot mascot within the adjustable reminders screen. This was to add a more light-hearted and visually-engaging feel to the experience.
